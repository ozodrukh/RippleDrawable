*RippleDrawable*
=============
Port of Android `<ripple>` effect for pre lollipop devices with android 14 + (ICS+)

(well, since NineOldAndroids is deprecated, this library become 14 + only)

### Features
1. XML inflating
2. Ripple supports different shapes
3. Custom drawable loader
4. Define your custom drawable tags

#### Implementation

Create your desirable ripple.xml in `drawable/` folder

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ripple
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:color="@color/ripple_material_light">     <!-- ripple color -->

    <!-- for Floating Action Button -->
    <item>
        <shape android:shape="oval">
            <solid android:color="@color/accent_material_dark"/>
        </shape>
    </item>

</ripple>

```

Secondly we need to inflate `RippleDrawable` and intercept `View` touches
see `LollipopDrawablesCompat` and `DrawableHotspotTouch` for inflating and interception sequently. Here is sample:

```java

public class SampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private FloatingActionButton mActionButton;

      @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_sample);
        
        mActionButton = (FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab);
        mActionButton.setBackgroundDrawable(getDrawable2(R.drawable.fab_background));
        mActionButton.setClickable(true);// if we don't set it true, ripple will not be played
        mActionButton.setOnTouchListener(
                new DrawableHotspotTouch((LollipopDrawable) mActionButton.getBackground()));
    }
    
/**
     * {@link #getDrawable(int)} is already taken by Android API
     * and method is final, so we need to give another name :(
     */
    public Drawable getDrawable2(int id){
        return LollipopDrawablesCompat.getDrawable(getResources(), id, getTheme());
    }
}

```

**Thats it!**

##Dependency

root build.gradle add a repository 
```groovy
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
```

and in application module just add
```groovy 
    dependencies {
            compile 'com.github.ozodrukh:RippleDrawable:2.0.1'
    }
```

#### a little bit more

you can inflate and create your own `Drawable`classes, here is tips & tricks

1 extend your Drawable from `LollipopDrawable`
```java
    public class LayerDrawable extends LollipopDrawable {
```

2 implement your own inflation
```java
    public void inflate(Resources r, XmlPullParser parser, AttributeSet attrs, Resources.Theme theme);
```
3 Register your `LollipopDrawable`
```java
static {   
    LollipopDrawablesCompat.registerDrawable(RippleDrawable.class, "ripple");
}
```

4 inflate it!
```java
    LollipopDrawablesCompat.getDrawable(getResources(), R.drawable.custom_drawable, getTheme());
```
