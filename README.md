Note
====

Use RippleDrawable with RecyclerView instead of using ListView or GridView, because of animation not work properly on last ones

Usage
-----

```java
    // New API for scroll containers
    RippleDrawable.makeFor(View target, ColorStateList colors, boolean parentIsScrollContainer)
    
    // For non scroll views
    RippleDrawable.makeFor(View target, ColorStateList colors);

    // Old api is supported Create circular ripple effect to view
    Button view = new Button(MainActivity.this);
    RippleDrawable.createRipple(view, getColor(R.color.material_blue_600));
    view.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener(){
      
      @Override
      public void onClick(View v){
        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Clicked", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
      }
      
    });
    
```

Add following in proguard rules to ensure that ripple effect works in release package.

    -keep class dreamers.graphics.** {*;}
